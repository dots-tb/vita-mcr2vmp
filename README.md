## Usage:

Drag and drop a PSOne MCR save file onto the program. It will generate a VMP that you may use with your Vita/PSP.
You may also drag and drop a VMP file and extract the contained MCR file for editing or sharing. 

Or use CMD:
	./vita-mcr2vmp <memorycard.mcr|SCEVMC*.VMP>

## Further Instructions:

	1. Grab your save data from here: ux0:/pspemu/PSP/SAVEDATA/<titleid>/SCEVMC<0|1>.VMP
	2. Run VMP file through program to export MCR.
	3. You may now use it with your save editor or emulators of choice.
