# vita-mcr2vmp
by [@dots_tb](https://github.com/dots-tb) - signs PSOne MCR files to create VMP files for use with Sony Vita/PSP and exports MCR files from VMP

## Usage:

Drag and drop a PSOne MCR save file onto the program. It will generate a VMP that you may use with your Vita/PSP. It will now also convert VMP to MCR.

You may also drag and drop a VMP file and extract the contained MCR file for editing or sharing. 

Or use CMD:
	./vita-mcr2vmp <memorycard.mcr|SCEVMC*.VMP>
